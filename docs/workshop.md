# Azure Cache for Redis Workshop

Welcome to this Azure Cache for Redis Workshop. You'll be experimenting with Azure Cache for Redis in multiple labs to discover how it's integrated to other Azure services by running a real world scenarios. Don't worry, even if the challenges will increase in difficulty, this is a step by step lab, you will be guided through the whole process.

During this workshop you will have the instructions to complete each steps. It is recommended to search for the answers in provided resources and links before looking at the solutions placed under the 'Toggle solution' panel.

# Lab 0 : Azure Cache for Redis

## Setting up the infrastructure in Azure

First thing you need to do is to download the [zip file][] that contains the infrastructure as code that needs to be deployed to do this Hands On Lab.

Once deploy open it and in a terminal run the following command to initialize terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

Then to deploy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

The deployment take between 15 to 25 minutes depending on the Azure demands.

## Architecture overview

While you are deploying the infrastructure of the labs, let's discover it together:

![Architecture overview](https://placehold.co/600x400)

## Seed the database

In this Hands On Lab, you will use a Cosmos DB database to store and retrieve your data. To be able to use it, you need to seed it with some data.

To do this, download the [zip file][database-seed-zip] that contains the data to seed your database, then unzip it and you will find a `products.json` file.

Go to your resource group, search the Cosmos DB account, select it and in the left menu, click on **Data Explorer**. Then, click on the database called `catalogdb` and click on the `products` container and select `Items`:

![Cosmos DB Data Explorer](./assets/cosmos-db-data-explorer.png)

Then, click on the **Upload Item** button and select the `products.json` file you just downloaded and click **Upload**. This will upload the data in your database:

![Cosmos DB Upload Item](./assets/cosmos-db-upload-item.png)

The number of products in the screenshot can differ from the number of products you have in your file.

Now if you close the **Upload Item** window and click on the **Refresh** button, you should see the data in your database:

![Cosmos DB Data](./assets/cosmos-db-data.png)

You have now seeded your database with the data you will use in this Hands On Lab.

## Redis basics 

To be able to use Azure Cache for Redis, you need to understand the basics of Redis. Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.

Let's see quickly how to use Redis using the Azure Cache for Redis. Go to your resource group, search the Azure Cache for Redis, select it and in the left menu, click on **Overview** and click on the **Console** button:

![Azure Cache for Redis Console](./assets/azure-cache-for-redis-console.png)

Now inside the console, let's play with basic Redis commands.

Run the following command to set a key/value pair in Redis:

```bash
set key1 myvalue1
```

To retrieve the value of the key, run the command:

```bash
get key1
```

To check if a key exists in Redis, just run:

```bash
exists key1
```

To delete a specific key in Redis, run the command:

```bash
del key
```

Run the following commands to set a key with an expiration of 10 seconds in Redis:

```bash
set key1 myvalue1
expire key1 10
```

After 10 seconds, if you run the `get` command on `key1`, you will see that the key will return `nil` which means that the key doesn't exist anymore.

To test if Redis is working, you can run the `ping` command:

```bash
ping
```

It should return `PONG` which means that Redis is working.

![Azure Cache for Redis Console](./assets/azure-cache-for-redis-console-demo.png)

To summarize, you can use the following basic commands to interact with Redis:

- `set` [key] [value]: Sets a key/value in the cache. Returns `OK` on success.
- `get` [key]: Gets a value from the cache.
- `exists` [key]: Returns `1` if the key exists in the cache, otherwise `0` if it doesnâ€™t.
- `del` [key]: Deletes the value associated with the key.
- `expire` [key] [value]: Expires the key after the specified number of seconds.
- `ping`: Ping the server. Returns `PONG`.

# Lab 1 : Redis setup in Azure Infra Environment 

## From DB search to introducing caching 
### Postman testing

---

# Lab 2 : Add cache to your API with APIM

In the previous lab, you saw how to add code in your API to be able to use an Azure Cache for Redis. In this lab, you will see how to add a cache to your API without modifing its code.

## Architecture recap

If you look at the architecture you deployed for this workshop, you will see that you have an API Management (APIM) in front of the API that provide you the different products.

![Architecture recap](https://placehold.co/600x400)

The APIM is used as a facade for all your APIs, in the next section you will discover how to add a cache on your APIs using the APIM and Azure Cache for Redis.

## Disabling cache in your API

In the previous lab, you added code in your API to use an Azure Cache for Redis. To be able to compare the performance of your API with and without the cache, you need to disable the cache in your API. 

To avoid modifying the code of your API, we have added an environment variable called `CACHE_ENABLED` that you can use to enable or disable the cache.

To disable the cache, you need to set the value of this environment variable to `false`. To do this, go to your resource group, search the App service, select it and in the left menu, click on **Configuration**. 
You will see the `CACHE_ENABLED` environment variable with the value `true` replace the value by `false` and click on the **Save** button:

![App service configuration](https://placehold.co/600x400)

Now if you try to call your API with Postman or the HTTP REST file you should see the response time of your API taking multiples seconds again.

## Setup APIM External 

First things you need to do, is to connect your Azure Cache for Redis to your APIM. To do this, you need to add it as an external cache in your APIM configuration.

So go to your resource group, search the API Management service (APIM), select it and in the left menu, click on **External cache**.

![External cache](./assets/apim-external-cache.png)

Then click on **Add** and fill the form with the following information:

- In the `Cache instance` field, select the Azure Cache for Redis you deployed in the previous lab.
- In the `Use from` field, set the region to `Default`, this will allow your Azure Cache for Redis to be used by all your APIM instances whatever their region.

![External cache form](./assets/apim-external-cache-form.png)

Then, click the **Save** button.

You should now see your Azure Cache for Redis in the list of external cache:

![External cache list](./assets/apim-external-cache-list.png)

### Setup APIM Cache Policy globally

Now that you have your Azure Cache for Redis connected to your APIM, you need to configure it to use it. To do this, you will use a policy.

Go to your resource group, search the API Management service (APIM), select it and in the left menu, click on **APIs**. You will see a **Product API** with a **Get Products** operation:

![APIM APIs](./assets/apim-api-get-products.png)

To be able to compare the performance of your API with and without the cache, you will first call it without the cache using [Postman][postman-link] or using the `products.http` inside the `Payloads` folder.

Go to the **Test** tab of the **Get Products** operation in your APIM and take the generated url inside the `Request URL` section.

If you use Postman and you should see the response of your API taking multiples seconds:

![Postman get products](https://placehold.co/600x400)

If you use the HTTP REST file you should see:

![HTTP REST get products](./assets/apim-http-rest-before-caching.png)

Now to reduce this time you can specify a policy to use the cache. Select `All operations` in the `Inbound processing` section and click on the **+ Add policy** button:

![APIM policy](./assets/apim-in-bound-policy.png)

Select the cache-lookup/store policy and click on the **Add** button:

![APIM cache-lookup policy](./assets/apim-cache-lookup-store-policy.png)

Set the duration to `30` seconds for the cache to be able to test it and click **Save**.

![APIM cache-lookup policy form](./assets/apim-cache-lookup-store-policy-form.png)

In real life scenario, this value will depend on your business needs.

That's it! You have now your cache policy setup globally to be used by your API. You can now test it again with Postman or HTTP REST you should see the response time of your API reduced to a few milliseconds!

### Caching a specific operation

In the previous section, you saw how to setup a cache policy globally for all your operations. But what if you want to cache only a specific operation?

Before you do this, you need to remove the global cache policy you just added. To do this, go to the **All operations** section of your API and click on the **...** button of the **cache-lookup** and the **cache-store** policies and select **Delete**:

![APIM remove policies](./assets/apim-remove-policies.png)

Then click on the **Save** button.

Now, to cache only the **Get Products** operation you need to specify the redis cache key. To be able to do this you will use two policies: `cache-lookup-value` `cache-store-value`. They are a bit different from the previous policies as they allow you to specify the key to use in the cache.

This time, you will need to edit the policy manually. So go to the **Get Products** operation and click one of the **Policy code editor** button:

![APIM policy code editor](./assets/apim-policy-code-editor.png)

Then, inside the editor replace the inbound block of the policy with the following content:

```xml
<inbound>
    <base />
    <cache-lookup-value key="products:all" variable-name="allproducts" caching-type="external" />
    <choose>
        <when condition="@(context.Variables.ContainsKey("allproducts"))">
            <return-response>
                <set-status code="200" reason="OK" />
                <set-header name="Content-Type" exists-action="override">
                    <value>application/json</value>
                </set-header>
                <set-body>@((string)context.Variables["allproducts"])</set-body>
            </return-response>
        </when>
        <otherwise />
    </choose>
</inbound>
```

This policy will first try to get the value from the cache using the key `products:all` and if it exists, it will return it. If it exists it will return the result of the cache directly using the `return-response`. If it doesn't exist, it will continue the execution of the policy.

Then, add the following policy in the outbound block of the policy:

```xml
<outbound>
    <base />
    <cache-store-value key="products:all" value="@((string)context.Response.Body.As<string>(preserveContent: true))" duration="60" caching-type="external" />
</outbound>
```

This policy will store the result of the operation in the cache using the key `products:all` and the value of the response body. It will store it for 60 seconds. Of course, you can change the key and the duration to fit your needs.

Notice the `external` cache type is used in both policies. This is because you are using an external cache which is Azure Cache for Redis in your case. If you were using the internal cache of the APIM, you would have used the `internal` cache type.

Then, click on the **Save** button.

You can now test your API again with Postman or the HTTP REST file like previously and you should see the response time of this particular operation reduced to a few milliseconds, but this time only for the **Get Products** operation.

# Lab 3 : Azure Cache for Redis Governance 

## Azure Monitor 

## Scaling 

## Security (RBAC + Private Endpoint ?)

# Lab 4 : Event-Driven Architecture 

In the previous lab about APIM you saw how to add a cache to your API without modifying its code. In this lab you will see how to refresh the cache when the data expired.

The idea is to use an Azure Function triggered by an Azure Cache for Redis event to refresh the cache when the data expired.

## Redis Triggered Azure Function

Open the Azure Function project in Visual Studio Code and go to the `ProductsCacheRefresh.cs`. You will discover a method called `ProductsEventsTrigger`.

This methods as an attribute called `RedisCacheTrigger` which is used to trigger the function when an event is raised by the Azure Cache for Redis.

```csharp
[RedisPubSubTrigger("REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING", "__keyspace@0__:*_%REDIS_PRODUCT_ALL%")] ChannelMessage channelMessage
```

This element is composed of two parts:
- The first part is the connection string of the Azure Cache for Redis defined in the environment variables. 
- The second part is the pattern of the event to listen to. In this case, it will listen to all the events that has a specific suffix value defined by the environment variables

Both environment variables are defined in the `local.settings.json` that you must create if you want to run this Azure Function locally (you have the template in the `local.settings.json.template` file).

The goal is to detect when the cache is expired and to refresh it for the `products:all` key. To do this, you will use the `ChannelMessage` object that contains the information about the event and listen to the `expired` event.
